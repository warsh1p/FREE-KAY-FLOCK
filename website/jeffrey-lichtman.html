        <h2>Why is he representing Kay Flock in his murder case?
        </h2>
        
    <p>
        Before we get into that, let's get into who exactly Jeffrey Lichtman is.
       
        </p>
        
        <p>
        
        Jeffrey Lichtman, born June 5, 1965 is a criminal defense lawyer who recieved his education in Emory University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1987, following it up by attending Duke University School of Law & graduating in 1990. Ever since then, he's been hired by countless people, including (but not limited to) El Chapo, John Gotti Jr, The Game, Fat Joe, etc.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Jeffrey has been noted as a well prepared man for his vehement cross-examination of the witnesses in court cases, leading to favorable results for the defense, some of which are completely amazing, such as the time where he got the sentence of a man accused of sexual assault  vacated. This means that the man who already served 27 years has won his freedom & does not have to return to prison again. Or the time he got a $6,000,000 medical fraud case dismissed, where his client was facing upwards of 25 years in prison. With these accomplishments in mind, it's no mystery as to why he's been awarded wtih a litany of awards, including being listed in the bar register of preeminent lawyers, where only 14,000 laywers out of 1,300,000 are listed. He's also recieved the highest rating from the Martindale-Hubbell Legal Directory, a prestegious law directory, as well as recieving the highest rating from the Avvo Lawyer Directory too. To top it all off, He's been named as a New York City Super Lawyer for being so ahead of the rest in his field of criminal defense.

        <p> <h2>So why Kay Flock?</h2>
        

    
        <p>
        Kay flock only hired Jeffrey Lichtman on March 2022. Considering that Jeffrey Lichtman was hired by the likes of El Chapo & John Gotti Jr. you would think that it would require a hefty amount of money to keep up. However, as you could see with the previous accomplishments, he is NOT your average lawyer. In fact, he's aware of who Kay Flock is & the situation he faced while allegedly shooting & killing Wasca in self-defense that it's not that far a stretch to think he's defending him at a discounted price. Why would I speculate this? In jeffrey Lichtman's own podcast "Beyond The Legal Limit with Jeffrey Lichtman" in the November 7, 2022 episode, he states that he once represented Rashaun Weaver, a then 14-year old black boy who was accused of killing a then 18-year old Tessa Majors in the infamous Tessa Majors robbery-turned-murder case for free, completely letting go of $500,000 in fees while working for months on end. He states that he did it because he felt empathy for him, & his childhood (or lack thereof) was enough to compel him to stand up for him.

        As we can see, Jeffrey Lichtman is a man of valor. To put it shortly, He's defending Kay flock because he has compassion for him. Seeing the security footage, it does in fact look like the person who is allegedly Kay Flock was defending him & his female companion from possible death from an aggresive person who had a gun in his pocket.

        <h2>So why is it taking so long?</h2>  
        
            
        <p>
        
        
        Accordiing to information from interviews & podcasts, the prosecutors from the State of New York, a young man & his team, were & are very hesitant to release information on about 31 witnesses due to "the fear of Kay Flock learning about them & having his gang memeber companions intimidate them" ever since the first court case Jeffrey Lichtman attended as Kay Flock's representative. For the several following court dates that they had, the prosecution continued to deny access to witness names for the defense, despite Jeffrey arguing for a compromise in which only he knows the names of the witnesses' so that he can cross-examine them & placing a protective order on the witnesses from Kay Flock so that he is not involved in getting access to their names. However, the small fame of Kay Flock is also taking a toll on the case, as in a court appearing, it was said by the prosecution that his fans sent death threats to the judge, giving further evidence to the claim that he is a dangerous man & that his defense should NOT get the names. However, there is a new judge on the case due to the previous judge being near their retirement age, & the prosecution that brought this up noted that "they didn't need to investigate" & that they "don't plan on doing it" when asked by Jeffrey to investigate the threat from Reddit. As of november 30, 2022, there is no update yet from Jeffrey Lichtman regarding the Kay Flock case, as his recent court appearance was on November 29, 2022. So far, the case is not inching forward, so we can expect the real trial to start in about a year or two.
